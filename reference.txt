# Step 1: Add all changes (deleted + new)
git add .

# Step 2: Commit with a message
git commit -m "Refactor: moved unused CSVs to not-use/"

# Step 3: Push to GitHub
git push origin main

#If youâ€™re still testing file moves and not ready to push, you can also just do:
git add -u      # Only stages deletions/renames
git commit -m "Clean up old CSVs"
