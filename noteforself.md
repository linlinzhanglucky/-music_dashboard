Q: how to Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:
* Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud
* Sign in with the GitHub account
* Click "New app"
* Select your repository, branch, and the main file (music_dashboard.py)
* Click "Deploy"

Streamlit Cloud will give you a public URL that you can share with anyone. They can view your dashboard without installing anything.
